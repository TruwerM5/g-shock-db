            "Introducing a collection of new G-SHOCK models whose 35mm diameter faces and large cases give them a look of power and strength. Dial rings and raised hour markers also create three-dimensional depth that gives the face plenty of character. These watches are designed and engineered to deliver outstanding shock resistance, are 200m water resistant, and anti-magnetic. The GA-100-1A1ER is beautifully finished in black with pure white hands and a reverse LCD display for a distinctive look.",
            "Over-sized buttons come with a checkered anti-slip surface to make operations fast and sure.",
            "1/1000-second stopwatch, velocity indicator, World Time, 5 alarms and much more provides these models with unmatched function and performance."

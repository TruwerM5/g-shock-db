            "This G-SHOCK 40th anniversary limited edition model is a collaboration between MR-G, the pinnacle of G-SHOCK, and Japan’s leading swordsmith, Gassan. The titanium band is designed to resemble a sword’s nakago (tang). The middle segments of the band are personally marked by swordsmith Sadanobu Gassan with a yasuri-me (file mark) pattern and carved with his signature. A yasuri-me (file mark) pattern is filed into a sword’s nakago (tang) to prevent it from slipping out of the grip. Sadanobu Gassan, a descendant of one of Japan’s most renowned swordsmith lineages, has carved kesho yasuri-me (decorative file mark) patterns, which give each timepiece a touch of elegance. Recrystallized hybrid titanium is a material that integrates multiple layers of titanium Ti64 and pure titanium in a way that the differences between the materials become visible when they are recrystallized. Taking advantage of this feature, we created a unique tempered ayasugi hada pattern under the supervision of renowned sword maker Sadanobu Gassan. Depending on the swordmaking school, different patterns manifest themselves when a sword blade is forged. The bezel, band, and back cover are coated with a newly developed blue-grey IP coating to reproduce the bluish iron colour that is the colour of high-quality swords. The case is made of pure recrystallized titanium and finished with deep hardening and a TIC coating. The letters \"G-SHOCK\" \"40TH\" are engraved on the plate on the side of the case at 10 o’clock. Function-wise, this special model is packed with various advanced practical functions made possible by Tough Solar, Bluetooth® smartphone linking, and time adjustment using Radio Controlled MultiBand 6 technology. The application of world-renowned traditional sword making techniques and advanced modern technology makes this a truly special modelT"
